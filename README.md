# Facial-Behaviour-Recognition-Using-ML
A CNN-based facial emotion recognition system detects five emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral) from 48Ã—48 grayscale images with ~80% accuracy. Using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Flask, it shows real-time predictions via an interactive bar graph, with future scope to add more emotions

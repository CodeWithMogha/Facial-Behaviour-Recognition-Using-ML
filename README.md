# Facial-Behaviour-Recognition-Using-ML
A CNN-based facial emotion recognition system detects five emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral) from 48Ã—48 grayscale images with ~80% accuracy. Using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Flask, it shows real-time predictions via an interactive bar graph, with future scope to add more emotions

## Features
- Detects facial emotions in real time
- Shows interactive bar graph
- Lightweight Flask backend

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Flask
